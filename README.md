# Multi-Component Optimization and Efficient Deployment of Neural-Networks on Resource-Constrained IoT Devices

**Overview:** The repo contains the code for an end-to-end multi-component NN optimizer to enable the execution of high memory and computation demanding models on MCUs, small CPUs, and AIOT boards. When any Machine Learning (ML) model is optimization sequence, the resultant models are much smaller in size, consume less power when execution, and show low latency. Our sequence is generic and applicable to any state-of-the-art models trained for anomaly detection, predictivemaintenance, machine vision, etc.

**Datasets used for demonstration:** For the experiments, we use the standard [MNIST Fashion](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist) (produces CNN1) and [MNIST Digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) (produces CNN_2) datasets to train a basic CNN.
